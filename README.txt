Welcome to the SupportShow Generator v1.0!

Things needed to run this program:
1. Windows 10 with PuTTY installed. (You can download the latest version of PuTTY here: https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html)
2. Your Brocade switch's IP Addres, administrator username, and password

To run the data collection script simply double click on the SupportShow.exe file located in this folder.
A window will pop out where you can input the IP Address, your username, and password.
Click on Generate SupportShow and wait for it to finish.
After the process is completed, TUF will open up on your computer's default browser.
The resulting SupportShow will appear in the same folder as the .exe file with the following format: IPAddres_Date.txt
This file is ready to be uploaded to the case, so do not hesitate to upload this to the TUF site that has opened up.

Thank you for using this program, have a great day!
